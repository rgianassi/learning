# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Guidelines

### Principles

    Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
    There should be an entry for every single version.
    The same types of changes should be grouped.
    Versions and sections should be linkable.
    The latest version comes first.
    The release date of each version is displayed.
    Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

### Types of changes

    Added for new features.
    Changed for changes in existing functionality.
    Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features.
    Removed for now removed features.
    Fixed for any bug fixes.
    Security in case of vulnerabilities.

### Unreleased section

    Keep an Unreleased section at the top to track upcoming changes.

    This serves two purposes:

    People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
    At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.
